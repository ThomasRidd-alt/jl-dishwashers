# Dishwasher product website

## Summary

Summary

## Assumptions

### Scope

- Progressive web-app
- Cross browser compatibility
- Screen sizes other than tablet landscape and portrait

### Design

If I were working with a designer I would seek clarification on certain design points.

- Product code is above the product information text on landscape and below on portrait. I have placed it above in both
  instances.
- The “Read more” section appears on the landscape design for the Product Item page. It does not appear on the portrait
  design. Possibly this is an accordion but a right pointing chevron says link. I would seek design intent before
  dedicating time to this feature so have left it out.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
